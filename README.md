# TouchControls

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6 Beta 5.

## Development server

Run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start both dev servers.
The first serves the static folder `WebComponentyPolymer/WebComponents`.
The second is the default Angular CLI development server.
To see the sample code running, go to `http://localhost:4200`. 

## Angular Elements

This repository contains a sample of the highly experimental Angular Elements API (https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/22413).
It runs in two ways:

1. Included within the normal demo (see _Development server_ above), navigate to _Numberpad (Angular Element)_
2. As a standalone variant (see `srcAngularElement`). To run, execute `npm run start-elements` and head to http://localhost:8080
